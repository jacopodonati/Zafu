# Zafu

Zafu is a meditation timer. For the first release I plan to have a simple timer not much different from the default timer app.

## Roadmap:

- [x]Â Having a working timer (2024-03-25)
  - [ ] ... with a final bell 
- [x] Show time left as ~some sort of a hourglass~ a simple countdown (2024-03-25)
- [ ] Let the user program complex timers, with repetitions, bells, etc.
  - [ ] ... warm up and cool down timers
  - [ ] timer loops
  - [ ] a different number of bells at the end of a timer
    - [ ] a different bell at the end of a timer
- [ ] Theming
